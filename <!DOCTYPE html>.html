      <p>We are so far apart it's not fun that we don't have OUR hangout
        space so I had the idea to make someplace where we could check up on each other.
        This is all a work in progress and I do not have a large end goal in mind,
        but I hope to see this grow as we do so I'll be adding things slowly. 
        Right now it is a little empty but I want you to be able to check up on it
        whenever you'd like and see that I DO think about you.
        It is just something to help you keep us in mind.
        Forever and always, Kohin. üíï</p>

        <p>My only Aarsi, you have been the blessing I don't deserve for the last 
          6 months. My whole world was pulling into your orbit in March and I have
          never regretted it. I can't lie to you and say I have always been so confident
          in us. My self doubt, lack of experience, and so many negative thoughts have
          made mind a mess. You have seen so many different Kohins. Not just emohin or 
          anything like that. You have seen me at my worst, so many angry, sad, moody
          childish sides of me I've shown you and you still always pick up the phone. I 
          owe you. I know you do not see it like this. But my future is ours, everything I 
          can or will be is yours to take part of. I haven't been happy for every day I've had to go through.
          You put so many problems to rest with your presence, I feel like theres nothing
          I can hide from you. As bright and kind as the sun you are so forgiving and 
          enticing. I can only regret that I hid my feelings for you as long as I did. 
          It was only a few days but still, I knew it was you from the start. You deserved a hug 
          at the end of the night in Fresno. I will give it back to you in Ottowa so wait for me.
          Lets dance sing and cry, lets have kids, vacations and sooo many anniversaries.
          Youre my future EVERYTHING so don't stress too much right now. And if you ever
          feel tired just know you can relax whenever you feel like it. I will never stop loving you.
          Forever and ever and ever and ever, Kohin  ‚ú®</p>
